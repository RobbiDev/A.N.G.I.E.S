# üñ• A.N.G.I.E.S 1.0

Welcome to the A.N.G.I.E.S project, named after the inspiration behind it, my girlfriend Angela. This project is designed to showcase my networking skills while creating a secure environment to store photos, financial data, and all other important aspects of my life. 

I'm relatively new to the world of networking, but I was determined to embark on my first project that would be both efficient and budget-friendly. While I acknowledge that there are more advanced solutions available, such as utilizing a POE HAT for the Raspberry Pi or considering alternative hardware options altogether, I wanted to start with a quick, accessible, and cost-effective approach.
